# Project Description
This project was made in a few hours, stemming from an idea which came to me as I woke up :)
The Viola-Jones-Algorithm-Alarm makes use of the OpenCV library (discussed below) in order to capture real time footage of a computer webcam, providing alerts whenever a face appears. Footage is consistently recorded and played back for the user, while also detecting the prescence of any defining facial features. A periodic timer occurs to process a single frame captured at that moment - If a rough outline of a face IS detected in the frame, an external JSON file is updated with the time of detection, the image is saved to an external folder to view later and a blaring alarm plays >:)

Making this fun program was an introductory gateway into object detection frameworks and computer vision alongside the brushing up of my python skills which I haven't done for a while (due to learning Java for my CS classes and JavaScript for my Discord bot).
